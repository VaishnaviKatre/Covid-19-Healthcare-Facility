# Covid-19-Healthcare-Facility
The project is made using python, which will help India prevent, detect, respond, and prepare for the Covid-19 pandemic and strengthen its public health awareness. It will create a list of all the patients who tested positive and their details. It uses a Python library to create a backend database that registers all the entries done throughout the day. The program also predicts if a person should be quarantined or not based on his/her past traveling history.
